# Create the Virtual Cloud Network #

In this step you will create a VCN with the quick start wizard. This will create all the related network resources including a public subnet, private subnet, internet gateway, NAT gateway, Service gateway, default security lists, and default route rules and table. 

We are taking the quick option, but there is also a custom option to create resources individually.
